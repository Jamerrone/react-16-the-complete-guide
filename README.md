# React 16 - The Complete Guide (SRP Point)

This repository is not a school, work or personal project. It is a learning/playground where I will be trying to teach myself the basics of the popular JavaScript library React, version 16 and beyond. There are two main reasons why I am doing this. In a couple of weeks, I will start a six months internship. Where I will be using multiple JS libraries like Vue JS and React. The thing is I have never used a library before. I did use some smaller codebases or projects from other people but never on this scale.

My second reason for doing this is SRP points. SRP points are "Self-learning points" where we HvA students need to comeup with projects related to our education and future carrier. Before we can complete our course and receive our diploma we need to have at least 4 SRP points. Each point is equivalent to 28 hours of self-learning.

There is, of course, multiple ways of learning a new language. I could, for example, follow youtube tutorials, read blog posts, read the React documentation, etc. The way I chose to do it, was by following a Udemy course while keeping the React documentation at hand.

The Udemy course I chose is [React 16 - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/learn/v4/overview) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller. While this course covers almost every topic, there is just so much you can do within the given time limit. I focused only on the basics and fundamentals. I can always come back for the more advanced topics on my own time.
